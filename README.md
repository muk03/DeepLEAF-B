# DeepLEAF-B: 
## ***Deep*** ***L***earning ***E***nabled ***A***nalysis ***F***ramework for ***B***-Meson Decays

This project aims to develop a deep learning (Neural Network) based analysis framework for B-Meson decays.

## Description

In place of physics based simulations and template fits we present the use of a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder to generate a 4-Dimensional Histogram of true observables and a dual annealing algorithm for regression using this network. A Graph Neural Network extends from True Observable so detector-smeared and measured observables. Both networks' hyperparameters are Bayesian-Optimised using python package Optuna.

Current build status is a proof of concept for cSR and cVR for the _b&rarr;cμ<sup>-</sup>ν<sub>μ</sub>_ and _b&rarr;cτ<sup>-</sup>ν<sub>τ</sub>_ decay modes.
